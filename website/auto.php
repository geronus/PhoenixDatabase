<p>Select everything in the text box below and paste it into a new bookmark (definitely works on chrome)</p>
<textarea style="width: 70%; height: 100px;">javascript:(function()%7Bfunction%20callback()%7BPhoenix.Prep()%7Dvar%20s%3Ddocument.createElement(%22script%22)%3Bs.src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fphoenix.rtehl33t.net%2Fauto.js%3Fv%3D2%22%3Bif(s.addEventListener)%7Bs.addEventListener(%22load%22%2Ccallback%2Cfalse)%7Delse%20if(s.readyState)%7Bs.onreadystatechange%3Dcallback%7Ddocument.body.appendChild(s)%3B%7D)()</textarea>
<p>The above only needs to be done once.  After that, when you login to Lyrania, just click on the bookmark(in the same page).  After a second or two, you'll notice a new button in the bottom
right of the screen called "Update Guild".</p>
<p>Click on that button and, again, after a few seconds, you'll see a popup that shows you that the guild was updated as well as alerting you to any unpaid GDP debt.</p>
